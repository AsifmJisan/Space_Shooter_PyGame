# How to Play The Game
W --> Up
A --> Left
S --> Down
D --> Right
SPACE --> Shoot  

The constants of the game (i. e. Player Speed, Enemy Bullet Speed) can be changed in the `# settings #` section of the code. the game runs at maximum 60 FPS in a 1280x720 window. I shall keep improving the game insha'Allah.

# Goal of The Game
The goal is to score as much as possible. No game over screen was added. So when you die, the game just closes.

# Use of AI
AI was used in this game but it is when I couldn't figure things out for a long time. But most of logic and lines are written by me.

# Developer's Note
This is my first successful PyGame. I am still learning. You'll definitely find mistakes in my code and may improve the code even better. Feel free to criticize the code as much as you like.
